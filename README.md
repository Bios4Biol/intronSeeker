intronSeeker
============

RNA-Seq reads quite often contain non-spliced introns. These introns originating from non mature mRNAs 
can break the translated protein Open Reading Frame. In order to get the 
correct protein sequence introns have to be removed.
Retained introns will be present in only some sequences nevertheless they 
can therefore be present in the corresponding assembled contigs.  
Introns are retained by "accident" meaning due to non mature transcripts present in the cell. These transcripts have not undergone complete splicing and therefore still harbor introns. The upstream step is not data processing but a biological process called splicing.

![](doc/IntronSeeker-glossary.png)

Splice site signal of these introns can be used to find and remove them. 
Intron splice site boundaries (canonical or not), the Open Reading Frame size
and related protein alignments can be used as different hints to measure the probabiliy
of having a retained intron.

We developped a tool to identify potentially retained introns in 
*de novo* RNA-seq assembly  in order to quantify and remove them.

This tool includes two types of RNA-seq data simulations to validate the 
detection process and measure the false positive detection rate. 

The first simulation module uses random sequence simulation in order to check if 
splice aligners are able to find inserted introns when only contigs with introns and reads
whithout intron are used as well as when contigs with and without introns and reads without introns are used.

The second simulation module uses an existing genome and corresponding annotation. 
In this case the simulator produces reads with an without intron as well as 
transcripts with and whithout introns. This modules enables to measure the fraction 
of retained introns which can be detected in real conditions and to set the 
appropriate detection thresholds.

Simulator and simulation data descriptions can be found in the SIMULATION.md file located in doc directory 
[here](./doc/SIMULATION.md)

How it works ?
--------------

#### Searching for introns

![](doc/IntronSeeker-workflow.png)

Dashed lines connectors are used to represent optional inputs files. 
Solid lines connectors are used to represent inputs and outputs files.

Inputs data for intronSeeker are raw RNASeq paired reads (R1.fastq and R2.fastq). These reads are aligned on the contigs with STAR or HiSAT2, according to user preferences. Splices sites are searched and intronSeeker generate a list of candidates and a list of splits alignements. This candidat file is then tested to check if they correspond to valid intron retention events.  A clean reference without introns is generated in Fasta format with TrimFasta step. From the reference  and trimmed Fasta files, intronSeeker predicts the Open  Reading  Frames and  find  proteic  hits to find evidences.


Simulated data are used for validating the method and measure the false positive detection rate. Intron detection never involve a simulation step.


The main pipeline step are:
1. Use [Star](https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR) or 
[Hisat2](https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/hisat2/index.shtml) to map reads on 
assembled contigs.

2. Search splice events in bam file using CIGAR string.

3. Write a file of intron candidats. 

How to install ?
----------------

To install intronSeeker, see the [INSTALL.md file](./INSTALL.md)

How to use ? 
------------

Here, we'll present a non-exhaustive documentation on how to use the intronSeeker 
program. For an exhaustive documentation about the different functions 
(description, options...), please see the README file in data directory. 
We'll just present a fast and basic usage with examples. All the 
input files or output files presented here are available in data directory. 

Before running any intronSeeker command, activate the conda environment with :

```diff
conda activate ISeeker_environment
```

##### Reads alignment on reference contigs : Hisat or Star.

From here, we will use files corresponding to reduced real dataset available 
in the data directory (this data comes from *Ceanhorhabditis elegans*). 


intronSeeker can use two aligners : STAR and Hisat2. Hisat2 gives better alignment
results but takes longer to run and works only with paired-end library.

The aligners we tested were the only two capable of handling alignments on contigs with and without the intron. We wrapped them to simplify their launch.

In introSeeker directory, in order to run alignment, use the commands :

```diff
./intronSeeker starAlignment -r data/Reduced_real_dataset/Test_set_Cele_contig-assembly.fasta -1 data/Reduced_real_dataset/Test_set_Cele_reads-1.fastq.gz -2 data/Reduced_real_dataset/Test_set_Cele_reads-2.fastq.gz -o data/test_Reduced_real_dataset/Cele_library-contigs_starAlignment
```

or 

```diff
./intronSeeker hisat2Alignment -r data/Reduced_real_dataset/Test_set_Cele_contig-assembly.fasta -1 data/Reduced_real_dataset/Test_set_Cele_reads-1.fastq.gz -2 data/Reduced_real_dataset/Test_set_Cele_reads-2.fastq.gz -o data/test_Reduced_real_dataset/Cele_library-contigs_HISAT2Alignment
```
N.B.: If you wish to re-run this step, it is necessary to change the name of your output directory.

##### Splicing event search 

When the alignment is finished, you can search for splicing events with HiSAT2:

```diff
./intronSeeker splitReadSearch -a data/test_Reduced_real_dataset/Cele_library-contigs_HISAT2Alignment/hisat2.sort.bam -r data/Reduced_real_dataset/Test_set_Cele_contig-assembly.fasta -o data/test_Reduced_real_dataset/Test_Cele_splicing_event_HISAT2
```

or with STAR:

```diff
./intronSeeker splitReadSearch -a data/test_Reduced_real_dataset/Cele_library-contigs_starAlignment/star.sort.bam -r data/Reduced_real_dataset/Test_set_Cele_contig-assembly.fasta -o data/test_Reduced_real_dataset/Test_Cele_splicing_event_STAR
```

##### List features by FASTA trimming

When trimFastaFromTXT produces a new FASTA reference file where features, listed in candidats file, are trimmed from the reference FASTA.

```diff
./intronSeeker trimFastaFromTXT -r data/Reduced_real_dataset/Test_set_Cele_contig-assembly.fasta -c data/test_Reduced_real_dataset/Test_Cele_splicing_event_HISAT2/srs_candidates.txt -o data/test_Reduced_real_dataset/Test_Cele_trimFASTA
```

##### Find evidence
 
If you have a reference protein set, you can perform a proteic alignment against the "reference" and "trimref" FASTA files to find evidences.

```diff
./intronSeeker findEvidence  -r data/Reduced_real_dataset/Test_set_Cele_contig-assembly.fasta -t data/Reduced_real_dataset/Test_Cele_trimFASTA/tf_trimmed.fa  -d data/Reduced_real_dataset/Test_protein-diamond-database.fasta  -c data/Reduced_real_dataset/Test_Cele_splicing_event_HISAT2/srs_candidates.txt -o data/Reduced_real_dataset/Test_Cele_FindEvidence
```

##### Generate a intronSeeker simulation report

Create a configuration file data/test_Reduced_real_dataset/buildReport_example.cfg :

```diff
[Defaults]
fasta:data/Reduced_real_dataset/Test_set_Cele_contig-assembly.fasta
r1:data/Reduced_real_dataset/Test_set_Cele_reads-1.fastq.gz
r2:data/Reduced_real_dataset/Test_set_Cele_reads-2.fastq.gz

prefix:Cele
threads:6             
output:test_HTML/
force: -F
```

```diff
./intronSeeker buildReport -F --config_file data/test_Reduced_real_dataset/buildReport_example.cfg 
```

Your HTML simulation report is available in test_HTML directory.

## Intron extraction results

Statistics from intronSeeker splitReadSeach step.

![Statistics from split alignment and candidates
files.](doc/SRS_IS.png)

The depth is the number of reads overlapping an intron. Difference between split mean length and detected intron mean length could be explain by the fact that several reads split on a same location so one candidat have several splits.

Evaluation of detected introns:

![Comparison between filtered detected and detectables
introns.](doc/detected_introns_IS.png)

Detected introns filtered from candidat file and detectable introns from GTF and modified FASTA files, filtered  according to threshold (a minimum depth (DP) and a maximum length (LEN)), canonical junction (SS), and the number of PASS introns.

Top 10 of contigs having the highest number of detected introns tab list contig name, number of detected introns (filtered detected introns), and number of detectable introns (filtered features).

![Top 10 of contigs with too complex detected and detectable introns on GBS data. Source: GBS simulation on 1 000 contigs (mixed state) of Drosophila m. with STAR mapping XXXXXXX](doc/too_complex_IS.png)

Evaluation of detected introns

![Raw and filtered introns.](doc/detected_introns_row_filtrered_IS.png)

Â« Number of detected introns Â» / Â« raw Â» = Total number (PASS + DP + LEN + SS) of introns listed in candidat file.

Â« Number of detected introns Â» / Â«filteredÂ» = Only Â« PASS Â» introns listed in candidat file.

Â« Number of features Â» / Â« raw Â» = Total number (PASS + DP + LEN + SS) of introns listed in GTF + modified fasta files.

Â« Number of features Â» / Â«filteredÂ» = Only Â« PASS Â» listed in GTF + modified fasta files.

Evaluation/prediction of detected introns

![Detection assessement.](doc/prediction_IS.png)

Sensibility is the fraction of \"detected filtered\" (201) presents in Â«Truth Â» (200) found by intronSeeker (195). Specificity is the fraction of truth Â« detected filtered Â» among all predicted.

#  IntronSeeker standard filters

By running several simulations and then searching for introns in real data, we were able to define standard filters.

Introns from candidat file have been detected and filtered according to a minimum depth, a maximum length and split borders should be canonicals.

Too complex introns are also filtered. An intron is too complex whether because of its size or because its an overlapping intron.


|  Filter name |  Description|
| :---    |         :--- |
|  DP      |      Filtered because of depth (). Candidates will be flagged if not supported by more than \[1\] read.|
|  LEN       |    Filtered because of length (%). Remove transcript if intron length greater than 80% of the total exons length|
|  SS     |       Filtered because of non canonical junction.|
|  OI   |         Filtered because of overlapping introns.v
|  RDP       |    if (DP_before + DP_after)/2 /5 \< DP_in|
|  PASS  |        After filtering, candidates are flagged PASS.|
